##Git training


Repository for the Meetup "Open source contribution training: Git" on 07/01/2016.
See on [Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/PyLadiesLondon/events/227540804/)


###Event description

There are several plans for us to contribute to open source projects at meetup events in the future.

In the meantime let's work on our Git skills in preparation! =)

[Git](http://git-scm.com/) is a widely used version control system which means it helps several people work on a project at the same time.

It's a great tool to master for open source but also professional as well as personal projects.

[Open Hatch](https://openhatch.org/) as several Training missions for contributing to open source.

We'll do the [Git mission](https://openhatch.org/missions/git) together.

Before the meetup: [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) if you don't already have it installed on your laptop.
